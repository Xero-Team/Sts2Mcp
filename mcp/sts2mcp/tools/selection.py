    Used when the game asks you to choose cards from your deck (transform, upgrade,
    enchant, remove, discard) or pick a card from offered choices (potions, effects).

    For deck selections: toggles card selection - a card that is already selected comes
    back out. The result reports `selected` and `selected_count`; game state carries
    `cards[].selected`, `selected_count` and `required_count`, so there is no need to
    count your own presses. For choose-a-card: picks immediately.

    Once `max_select` cards are selected the screen opens its preview by itself, and
    further selecting is refused until you confirm or cancel it (a preview open
    blocks toggling).
